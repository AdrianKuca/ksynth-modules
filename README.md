# ksynth-modules
Kicad PCB projects for my ongoing adventure in making an digital-analog synthesizer from ground up, including software (which gonna be in separate repos). 

The first board is FX0, universal board which can hold line in/out and cv in/out. 
Doesn't use a microprocessor by itself but instead uses whole modules: raspbbery pi Pico, seeduino Xiao or arduino pro micro (only one should be soldered at once).
